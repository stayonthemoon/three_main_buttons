# Animated Buttons

## Thoughts

These buttons can be reused in different projects. It's a simple way to add some visual interest to a web page without much code.

## About

This project is about just animated buttons using HTML and CSS. The buttons have hover effects and color transitions. I've skipped animation with JS to not over-do buttons.

## Features

- 3 buttons: Submit, Cancel, and Re-do
- Each button has its own color scheme
- Submit and Re-do buttons scale up and move slightly upward on hover
- Cancel button has a shake effect on hover
- All buttons have a color transition effect

## How to Use

1. Download the HTML and CSS file
2. Open HTML it in a web browser

## Benefits

- Adds visuals to web pages
- Easy to implement and make changes in colour
- You may add more animation with JS but it's not necessary cause it looks good even that way ðŸ˜Š
- Responsive design
